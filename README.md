# Interview Ready

The goal of this project is to prepare software engineers for coding interviews and give meaningful direction in where they should spend their preparation time.


## Readiness Criteria

If you are ready for an interview then you should be able to solve a medium to hard interview problem in the general time window that an interview gives you. Online assessments can be merciless and require 100% passing, but give you potentially more time. In person interviews allow you to talk to a solution and they may accept an unfinished solution that was trending to success. Some companies may ask easy questions, but this tool is designed to prepare you for all types of software engineer posisitions.

This is the default. A "difficult" problem is defined as Medium difficutly level with acceptance rate under 55% or Hard difficulty level.

- Easy questions count for 10 points
- Medium questions over 55 acceptance rate count for 25 points.
- Medium under accept rate 55 and Hard questions count for 100 points
- If you look at the discussion tab first you only get one quarter of your points.
- If you look at the discussion tab *after* succeeding on a question you get a bonus 10 points.

20% of the score is reserved for questions completed within 60 minutes and having no view of the discussions tab beforehand.

Points are tallied and normalized by target topics. Once you have 500 points you get your "ready status". However, if you haven't
solved any "difficult" problem in under an hour than your score can only be 80%. To get to 90% you at least need to have solved one
"difficult" problem in under an hour. To get to 100% or "Ready" you must have solved at least two.
